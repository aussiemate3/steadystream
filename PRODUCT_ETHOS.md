# Product Ethos: Feel Better, Not More Often

SteadyStream is designed for **emotional quality over frequency of use**.

We don't chase engagement metrics; we design moments of calm, connection, and curiosity.

## The Core Test

Every feature must pass this test:

- **Does it help users *feel better* when they open the app?**
- **Or does it just make them open it *more often*?**

**If it's the latter, we don't build it.**

## Design Principles

This ethos guides every product decision we make:

### What We Build
- Features that create meaningful connections
- Tools that promote calm and intentional use
- Experiences that respect users' time and attention
- Interfaces that reduce anxiety and FOMO
- Chronological, predictable content flow

### What We Don't Build
- Infinite scroll mechanisms designed to trap attention
- Notification systems that create anxiety or urgency
- Engagement-optimizing algorithms that prioritize time spent
- Features that exploit psychological vulnerabilities
- Dark patterns that manipulate user behavior

## Evaluation Framework

When considering a new feature, ask:

1. **Does this make the user feel calm or anxious?**
2. **Does this respect their time or waste it?**
3. **Does this create genuine connection or performative engagement?**
4. **Would we want our loved ones using this feature?**
5. **Does this align with "feel better, not more often"?**

If any answer conflicts with our ethos, we revise or reject the feature.

## For Future Contributors

This document isn't just philosophy - it's our product roadmap filter. When in doubt about a feature decision, return to this ethos. SteadyStream exists to prove that social technology can prioritize human wellbeing over growth metrics.

**Build with intention. Design for humanity.**
